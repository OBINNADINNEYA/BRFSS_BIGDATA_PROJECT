# Perceived Health Determinants Study

## Overview

This research project delves into the profound effects of behavioral lifestyle choices, socioeconomic status, and healthcare access on individuals' perceived health. By examining these core determinants, the study quantifies their impact and provides critical insights for tailoring personalized healthcare interventions and shaping informed public health policies.

## Research Objectives

The study is guided by pivotal questions to explore the nexus between lifestyle choices and health perceptions:

- **Dietary Habits**: How do dietary habits, particularly the consumption of fruits and vegetables, relate to overall health outcomes and perceptions?
- **Socioeconomic Status**: What influence does socioeconomic status, including racial and ethnic factors, have on healthcare accessibility and health outcomes?
- **Physical Activity**: How does engagement in physical activities impact the likelihood of chronic disease occurrence and mental health conditions?
- **Chronic Conditions**: Can a correlation be established between chronic conditions and self-assessed health status?
- **Predictive Analysis**: Is it feasible to accurately predict perceived health using an integrative analysis of dietary, socioeconomic, lifestyle, and personal health metrics?

## Data Exploration

This analysis utilizes data from the **2019 and 2021 SMART: BRFSS City and County datasets** provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The datasets include a comprehensive array of variables, which will be refined to concentrate on those most relevant to the research objectives.

## Analytical Approach

Our methodology employs predictive modeling techniques, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, K-nearest neighbors, and Neural Networks, to explore the datasets' shared features and their predictive capabilities. The analysis is performed using Python, with extensive use of libraries such as TensorFlow, Seaborn, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and Pandas for data processing and analysis. Tableau is used for data visualization to illustrate the findings effectively.

## Expected Outcomes

This research aims to elucidate the intricate interplay between lifestyle, socioeconomic status, and perceived health. The findings are expected to inform public health strategies, healthcare practices, and individual lifestyle choices, contributing to the enhanced well-being of diverse populations.
