# Project Summary

This project delves into the significant influence of behavioral lifestyle choices, socioeconomic status, and access to healthcare on individuals' perceived health. These factors are key determinants that profoundly impact overall health and well-being. The research aims to quantify the extent to which each factor affects an individual's perception of their health, providing essential insights into personalized healthcare interventions and informed public health policies.

## Research Questions

The project aims to answer the following research questions:

1. How do dietary habits and nutrition shape an individual's health outcome?
2. What is the role of socioeconomic status and access to healthcare in predicting health outcomes?
3. Can lifestyle factors, including smoking and alcohol consumption, predict health risks and outcomes?
4. How predictable are chronic diseases, such as diabetes and hypertension, through a combined analysis of lifestyle factors and genetic predisposition?
5. What is the significant contribution of mental health factors, such as stress, anxiety, and depression, to health outcomes, and what pathways influence overall well-being?

## Data Source

To answer these research questions, this research project will utilize the 2021 SMART: BRFSS City and County Data and Documentation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021).

The dataset comprises 152 variables, including answers to a questionnaire and output variables calculated from input variables. An essential aspect of the approach involves reducing the dataset's complexity based on variable importance and relevance to the research questions. This targeted reduction enables a more focused and practical analysis, aligning the variables under examination with the core objectives of the project.

## Methodology

The proposed methodology leverages themes such as predictive analysis techniques, focusing on classification. The models employed include Decision trees, Random Forests, K-nearest neighbors, and neural networks. Python and Tableau are the primary tools used for this research project. Python libraries, including TensorFlow, Seaborn, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Data Profiling, are utilized for analysis.

## Project Impact

This research project explores the intricate interplay between behavioral and socioeconomic factors and perceived health. The anticipated findings aim to inform and guide public health strategies, healthcare practices, and individual lifestyle modifications, ultimately advancing the well-being of diverse populations.
